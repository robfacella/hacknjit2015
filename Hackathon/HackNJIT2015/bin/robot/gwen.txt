Uh huh, this my sh**
All the girls stomp your feet like this

A few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl

Oh, this my sh**, this my sh**
Oh, this my sh**, this my sh**
Oh, this my sh**, this my sh**
Oh, this my sh**, this my sh**

I heard that you were talking sh**
And you didn't think that I would hear it
People hear you talking like that, getting everybody fired up
So I'm ready to attack, gonna lead the pack
Gonna get a touchdown, gonna take you out
That's right, put your pom-poms down, getting everybody fired up

A few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl 
I ain't no hollaback girl

Oh, this my sh**, this my sh**
Oh, this my sh**, this my sh**
Oh, this my sh**, this my sh**
Oh, this my sh**, this my sh**

So that's right dude, meet me at the bleachers
No principals,no student-teachers
Both of us want to be the winner, but there can only be one
So I'm gonna fight, gonna give it my all
Gonna make you fall, gonna sock it to you
That's right I'm the last one standing, another one bites the dust

A few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl 
I ain't no hollaback girl

Oh, this my sh**, this my sh**
Oh, this my sh**, this my sh**
Oh, this my sh**, this my sh**
Oh, this my sh**, this my sh**
